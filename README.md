Hi!

This app in its' basic form was a Coders Lab workshop and I based API Service on the code prepared by my mentors. Therefore, please be advised not to
reuse it commercially!

I added some functionalities, such as e.g.:
* option to hide loaded operations (with a checkbox at the top or for a single task with a button), 
* refresh button at the bottom of the page (works exactly the same as your browser refresh button),
* TIMER !!! <- It updates the timeSpent attribute of an operation every second and registers it with API. When time reaches 0, operation expires.
* remove time button - resets timeSpent attribute of an operation, registers with API.
* option to remove completed (finished) tasks - deletes with API.

Also, the base code was slightly bugged so I corrected it.
